Semi-finished...
Current functionalities:
- Generating numbers whose size in digits may fill up the RAM if you so wish
- Adding those numbers together and printing the result in terminal

Current issues + TODO:
- Numbers must be of same length, this issue is easily fixed and will be soon.
- Number generation currently exists as digit per digit entry, will add functionality to save as file, and to read from file instead.

Future:
- Add subtraction, multiplication and division.
- Add floating point operations.
